QUESTION 5: What issues may happen if the robot that finished the
task is assigned a new task immediately? And what will be a potential
solution for the issues?

	The 5 second delay accounts for the time it takes to do the task and put the tools back.
	If the robot has a new task to do immediately, then it shouldn't waste time putting down the tools.
	A potential solution is to separate the function into two
	different ones: One that accounts for the time it takes to
	complete the task and another that accounts for the time 
	it takes to put down the tools.
